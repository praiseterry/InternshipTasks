# Slash Mark Cybersecurity Internship

## Contents

### Basic
#### Task 1: Text Encryption Using Cryptographic Algorithms
**Description**: Build a simple web application to encrypt and decrypt textual information that the user keys in. Remember that strong encryption should produce different outputs even given the same input.

#### Task 2: Keylogger Software
**Description**: Keylogger software is a good beginner-level cyber security project. A keylogger is software used to record every keystroke made by the user on their keyboard devices.

#### Task 3: Image Encryption
**Description**: The images must be encrypted in such a way that even with arbitrary access to them via the internet, the image must not be decryptable without a secure key. This project will help you delve into the basics of cybersecurity and develop your cryptography skills.

### Intermediate
#### Task 1: Web-Based Facial Authentication System
**Description**: The web face detector can also be designed to view faces in a video call. We need to get started with this project using an OpenCV and a webcam. OpenCV is a real-time computer vision tool. This project can be extended for use cases like user authentication in meetings, exams, police force, face unlock feature of phones, etc.

#### Task 2: Credit Card Encryption and Decryption
**Description**: This project helps you combine your cloud computing skills with your cybersecurity journey. Access control management and cryptography are key skills for this project.

### Advanced
#### Final Task: User Authentication System
**Description**: The user authentication system is widely used software across every industry. This advanced-level cybersecurity project adds weight to your cybersecurity profile and intrigues potential recruiters.
